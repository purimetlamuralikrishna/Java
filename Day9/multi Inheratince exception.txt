Q) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?



	To prevent a ambiguity in Java.
		
	Example:    let class C extends Class A and Class B.
		    Class A and Class B has same display().
				class A{
					display(){
						System.out.println("This is class A method");
					}
				}
				class B{
					display(){
						System.out.println("This is class B method");
					}
				}
		     if we create an object of C class and call display() method this causes ambiguity in Java.So Java won't support Multiple inheritance
		     at class level.
