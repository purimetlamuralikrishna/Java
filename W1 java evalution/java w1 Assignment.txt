String:
	- String is a pre defined class
	- Strings are premitive data types which are immutable.Because when the String value is defined they are stored in a String pool area in RAM.
	- In this String pool area the values cannot modified.
	- String are premitive data types so they cannot me modified.

Difference between String and String Builder

	- the value created by String are immutable but the value created by StringBuilder are mutable.
	- String cannot be modified where as Stringbuilder can be modified.
	- String values are stored in string pool area where stringBuilders has a reference address.

Methods Of String Class:

	- .length returns the length of the string.
		eg: String name = "Murali";
			System.out.println(name.length); // output is 6
	-.charAt(int i)  returns the charvalue at the index[i]
		eg:     System.out.println(name.charAt(0)); //output is 'M'

	- .concat this method concatinates the one to another string but the original string remains same.
		eg:     System.out.println(name.concat("Krishna")); // output is "MuraliKrishna"

	- .trim this method removes the spaces of the string at start and end position of the string.
		eg:    name.trim()
