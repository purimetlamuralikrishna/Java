Q)   Explain abstract class and interface with an example?


	--> The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class and the interface keyword is used to declare interface.
	--> Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods and the Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also
	--> Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables and Interface has only static and final variables.
	--> An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends" and An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".
	--> Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface and Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
	--> Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance and Interface supports multiple inheritance.
	--> Example of abstract class:

		public abstract class Shape{
			public abstract void draw();
		}

	-->Example of interface class:

		public interface Drawable{
			void draw();
		}
